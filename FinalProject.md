# Final Project: Why is Pittsburgh Black Population Declining? 

My final project was completed in three parts; the associated write-ups for each part are linked below. The first link provides an overview of the project with an outline, initial sketches, and data sources. The second link has a draft storyboard of the final project, descriptions of the target audience, and user research conducted with the storyboard. The third link includes concluding reflections on the final project product, process, and tools, as well as a link to the final story.
