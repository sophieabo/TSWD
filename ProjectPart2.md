# Final Project Part II: Wireframes, Storyboard, and User Research

## Storyboard with Wireframes 
I used Shorthand to create a storyboard, or draft, of my final report. Due to time constraints, I decided that becoming familiar with Shorthand and creating a draft this week will be useful for completing the final project on time. I tried to create the most complete draft I could given the limited time, so that the feedback would be the most constructive possible. I iterated on my sketches from Part I and created visualization drafts in Flourish, Tableau, and Canva. I started exploring features in Shorthand (types of blocks, color, layouts etc.), but I look forward to more effectively using those design elements in the final draft.

## User Research

To get feedback on my storyboard, I conducted user research. Below I define my target audience, list the interview questions, compile the interview responses, and identify the interview takeaways. 

### Target Audience 

Since the subject of this presentation is Allegheny County demographic shifts, the target audience for this project are Allegheny County residents. Specifically, I envision the audience to be Pittsburghers and Allegheny County residents who are politically engaged, but might not have heard about the most recent census data or demographic shifts. I am assuming that the audience has a basic understanding of Western Pennsylvania geography and racial equity issues. 

I interviewed several civically engaged Allegheny County residents, who are interested in improving the quality of life in the region. The first interviewee is a white 25 year old female who grew up in Pittsburgh, but now lives in Washington D.C. working in the international aid sector. The second interviewee is a white 26 year old female who grew up in Pittsburgh, but now lives New York City. The third interviewee is a white 26 year old male who grew up in Boston, but now lives in Pittsburgh and is also engaged in local politics and social justice. The fourth interviewee is a white 24 year old female who grew up in Kentucky, but now lives in Pittsburgh and is familiar with local politics.

Given the short timeframe and the holiday, I had limited access to interviewees. In future iterations of the project, I would love to interview Black Allegheny County residents who either have moved from or stayed in the City of Pittsburgh. 

### Interview Script

**Introduction:** Thank you for agreeing to provide feedback on my project about demographic shifts in Allegheny County for my Telling Stories with Data class. This is a draft or “storyboard” version of the project, so the words and visualizations are not finalized. I am hoping to get your feedback on the order and flow of the narrative, and the current visualizations. Start by taking a moment to scroll through the project, and then I am going to ask you a couple questions.

**Question 1:** Can you describe the overall narrative of this project? What is the takeaway?

**Question 2:** Who do you think is the intended audience for this project?

**Question 3:** What do you think about the flow of the project? What (if anything) would you change?

**Question 4:** Do you think the current visualizations effectively support the narrative? How would you change them (titles, colors, type of visualization)?

**Question 5:** Are you inclined to do the call to actions at the end of the piece? Do you other suggestions for actionable 

**Conclusion:** Thank you so much for taking the time to give me feedback. I will make sure to send you the final version next week!

### Interview Responses

**Question 1: Can you describe the overall narrative of this project? What is the takeaway?**
- User 1: "Pittsburgh is losing its black population despite otherwise relatively stable population changes. This could be due to increased cost of living or -black residents seeking better opportunities. It could be combated by inclusive zoning legislation."
- User 2: "Although the overall population of Pittsburgh has stabilized over the past 10 years, the population of Black Pittsburghers has decreased dramatically. Although the cause is not confirmed, the trend has negative consequences and is worth paying attention to."
- User 3: "Black people are moving out of Pittsburgh much faster than other population groups. Two theories are offered to explain this departure: Black Pittsburghers are getting priced out of the city, and are seeking better schools."
- User 4: "The Black population in Pittsburgh is declining far more than the rest of the population. There are two theories around why this may be: a push out due to gentrification or a pull towards better opportunities/schools. The City needs to figure out why the Black population is leaving because it has many negative effects on the City."


**Question 2: Who do you think is the intended audience for this project?**
- User 1: "Pittsburgh residents/voters, Pittsburgh government officials"
- User 2: "Residents of the city of Pittsburgh"
- User 3: "I thought it was government for most of the presentation, but then the CTA seems like it’s addressed more to your everyday Pittsburgher." 
- User 4: "City of Pittsburgh residents"

**Question 3: What do you think about the flow of the project? What (if anything) would you change?**
- User 1: "I think it has a pretty logical flow and the case is made."
- User 2: "The flow makes sense to me"
- User 3: "Would change some syntax/phrasing, but the flow feels straightforward." 
- User 4: "The flow made sense to me! I think maybe instead of focusing on the data you don’t have around the housing part maybe just sum that up in a small blurb of needing further analysis. I don’t think you need to draw too much attention to you thinking you don’t have the right data or enough data."

**Question 4: Do you think the current visualizations effectively support the narrative? How would you change them (titles, colors, type of visualization)?** 
- User 1: "I think they’re good and add to the project. It would be helpful to see rental costs changing over time but as you mentioned, that data isn’t available. Maybe change in the median home cost in Pittsburgh over the last ten years?"
- User 2: "The only thing I don’t like is the icons for why the city of pittsburgh should care. It feels weird to have icons on right and text on left and also idk if tarnished reputation swirl makes sense to me"
- User 3: "I’d clean up the icons in the “Why Should Pittsburgh Care” section, and make them a little sharper (maybe hovering over each one brings up its blurb). I do LOVE the interactive map showing where people are moving to." 
- User 4: "I think the current visualizations support the narrative. I like that you have maintained a consistent color scheme as well. I think the icons could maybe be formatted better and maybe be blue/orange to keep up with the theme."

**Question 5: Are you inclined to do the call to actions at the end of the piece? Do you other suggestions for actionable**
- User 1: "Yes, and I don’t have any other suggestions."
- User 2: "Maybe add a button to share the article?"
- User 3: "Yes I think the CTA button color makes it very appealing. I wonder if there’s some petition or list that adding one’s name to could be a CTA." 
- User 4: "Yes, I am inclined to do the call to action. Just a thought but if there is some organization or group that is working to support Black Pittsburghers, you could have a call to action around volunteering or donating."

### Interview Takeaways

The users all successfully identified the central narrative of the story and thought that the piece flowed well. They all also understood that Pittsburgh residents are the target audience. User 3 specifically gathered this information from the call to action; this hopefully means that the call to action is useful for my targeted audience. I liked User 4's additional suggestion of supporting organizations that are focused on improving the quality of life for Black Pittsburghers. One piece of feedback that all of the users suggested was to clean up the icons under the “Why Should Pittsburgh Care” section. I agree that the resolution of this image could be better, they could use some color, and that the icons might not be the best possible icons for the subcategories. 

## Next Steps

From this user feedback exercise and the feedback I received in class, I have several actionable next steps. First, I need to finish adding the text in the piece. I had a good conversation with my group mates in class about how much text should be included in a piece like this - I hope to strike the right balance in my final draft! Second, I will think through the “Why Should Pittsburgh Care” section. I will fix the resolution of the image, add color, and perhaps, change the titles of the subsections. I will also think about whether there is a more interactive way to represent this information. Third, I will experiment with and utilize Shorthand’s design elements. My groupmates taught me how to directly embed visualizations so that the graphs are larger, how to change the font size, and how to add a “button.” Fourth, I will other explore calls to action and choose the most actionable ones. Fifth, I need to add the references section at the bottom of the piece.
