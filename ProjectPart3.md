# Final Project Part III: Final Data Story and Presentation 

## Reflections

As described in Part II, my intended audience for this story is Pittsburghers and Allegheny County residents who are politically engaged, but might not have heard about the most recent census data or demographic shifts. When putting together this project, I assumed that the audience has a basic understanding of Western Pennsylvania geography and racial equity issues. During the user research stage, I interviewed four people who qualified as my “target audience.” Their responses and feedback indicated that the project was well-tailored to this audience. I believe that the simple visuals guide the audience through the story, and the text and references provide additional context and information if the audience chooses to engage further. The story does not dedicate space to describing the basic geography and racial dynamics of the Allegheny County region. This makes the story more concise, and therefore, the audience is more likely to read the full piece. As mentioned in Part II, I wish I had interviewed Black Allegheny County residents who either have moved from or stayed in the City of Pittsburgh. Their insights could have made the story both more accurate and personal. In future iterations of the project I would love to pair their perspectives with the insights I derived from the data sets. 

The user research was a necessary step in creating the final product. After receiving feedback from all of my interviewees about improving the “Why Should Pittsburgh Care?” section, I explored Canva, Flourish, and Tableau to see if I could represent the information in a more aesthetically pleasing and interactive way. I found an experimental template in Flourish and customized it to present the “Why Should Pittsburgh Care?” information. I also changed some of the titles and text in that section to better support my story. After making this change, I consulted one of my interviewees for additional feedback, and they agreed this was a much better representation of the information. 

Another valuable piece of feedback I received during the user research phase, was to change the call to action to donate/volunteer with an organization that is working to support Black Pittsburghers. I thought this was a much more tangible call to action than contacting the City of Pittsburgh Office of Equity. I made this change in the final version of the story. 

The design of my story was for the most part designated by the Shorthand basic template. I chose a color scheme of black, white, blue, and orange. The blue and orange inspiration came from the choropleth map I created illustrating the change in populations in Allegheny County municipalities. I thought those colors did a good job representing declines in Black populations (orange) and increases in black populations (blue). I did not want to use a red and blue scheme, at the risk of evoking political references. I tried to use the same hex code colors and fonts throughout the visualizations and text, when possible. 

When trying to use consistent fonts, I noticed a clear limitation of the Shorthand, Flourish, and Tableau softwares. Each platform only had a few fonts to choose from, and the platforms required CSS overrides to add other fonts. Given the limited time frame of this project, I was unable to figure out a work-around. Therefore, I feel that the story does not look as polished as it could be. 

Another limitation that I found with Shorthand was that the section formatting is very rigid. For example, I could only embed the visualizations in a text section which made the visualizations quite small, or I could embed the visualizations in a custom html section which made the visualizations the size of the whole page. I wish I was able to make the visualizations somewhere in between those two sizes. I also wish that the “text” section formatting was not so narrow! I found that default design choice very odd. 

Overall, I am grateful for the opportunity to learn about and practice using several plug-and-play visualization tools. I am confident that with more time and familiarity, I would be able to better utilize the tools to improve the output visualizations. This project made me realize how time-intensive finding, cleaning, and making data visualizations can be. It also made me realize that interactive data visualizations are so much more effective at telling stories than traditional modes of communication.
