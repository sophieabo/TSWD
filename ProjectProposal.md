# Final Project Proposal 
## Overview 
In my final project I will explore the question: **Why is Pittsburgh’s Black population declining?**  

With the release of the 2020 census data this summer, I read several local news articles highlighting the outmigration of Pittsburgh’s Black population to the Allegheny County suburbs. And in my real estate development class this semester, I have been studying the future development of the Lincoln-Lemington-Belmar neighborhood, which is on the north-eastern edge of the City of Pittsburgh. I have recently been thinking about what effect this demographic shift will have on the future of that neighborhood and the City of Pittsburgh more broadly. 

The new census results finally provide data to support this demographic trend that has been discussed anecdotally over the last five to ten years. Nonetheless, there is still uncertainty around why the outflow of Black Pittsburghers is occurring. There are two schools of thought about what is driving this outmigration. 
- Searching for opportunity: Black Pittsburghers are leaving disinvested neighborhoods in search of better schools, safer neighborhoods, and more plentiful employment opportunities. 
- Gentrification: Black Pittsburghers are fleeing to the suburbs due to rising housing costs and property taxes. 

Ultimately, this trend is probably caused by a combination of these factors. Regardless, this trend illustrates that Black residents do not feel like they can thrive in the City of Pittsburgh. This demographic shift is concerning for the City of Pittsburgh for many reasons. 

##### Decreasing Tax Base
It is difficult to support the same critical infrastructure and school system with less revenue. 

##### Reduced Labor Pool
Employers are already facing historic difficulty hiring, and losing working age folks will only exacerbate that. A sufficient and diverse talent pool is also important for attracting new employers to the region. 

##### Tarnished Reputation 

It is hard to stop the bleed. As Brookings Fellow and Pittsburgh native Andre Perry noted, “You don’t just lose talent. You lose a mindset… It really hurts the city more than just the loss of a person,” (Pittsburgh City Paper, 2021). If the City doesn’t address the outflow now, then it may well spiral out of control.

##### Increased Sprawl

Suburban migration encourages automobile-oriented culture and urban sprawl, and an increased reliance on cars increases greenhouse gas emissions. Also, when amenities and people are located far away from each other, the regional infrastructure burden and costs increase. 

For these reasons, my call to action is that the City of Pittsburgh create a task force dedicated to researching and recommending specific measures to improve the quality of life for Black Pittsburghers. Specifically, readers should contact the incoming Gainey administration and demand that retaining Black residents must be a policy priority during his time in office. 

## Outline 
Following the reasoning described in the overview section, the outline for the project is detailed below. I am still iterating on how to start the piece and the order of the elements.

1. City of Pittsburgh Population Decreased from 2010 to 2020
- Visualization type: Call-out statistic
- Color: Red to illustrate the negative trend 
- Context: This is not a good trend for the City of Pittsburgh
- Source: Census


2. Allegheny County Population Increased For the First Time Since 1960
- Visualization type: Bar chart with ticks marks at 1960, 1970, 1980, 1990, 2000, 2010, 2020
- Color: Use the theme color to highlight positive population growth
- Context: Allegheny County is recovering from its post-industrial population loss, but Pittsburgh is not experiencing the same trend. 
- Source: Census 


3. City of Pittsburgh Population Change by Race from 2010 to 2020
- Visualization type: Table (or bar chart)
- Color: Use red or theme color to highlight large negative percent change in Pittsburgh’s Black population 
- Context: Approxaetly 10,000 Black residents left the City of Pittsburgh
- Source: Census
 
 
4. Black Population Increased in Allegheny County Suburbs 
- Visualization type: Choropleth map 
- Color: Theme color distribution representing the percent increase in Black residents

5. What Could Explain This Demographic Shift? 
- Visualization type: Infographic with a symbol representing each factor

6. School Districts are Better in Municipalities with an Increase in Black Population
- Visualization type: Descending table or map with school scores
- Color: Use the theme color to highlight school district scores in municipalities where the Black population has increased 
- Context: Black families are searching for opportunity outside the City of Pittsburgh
- Source: US News & World Report 


7. Housing Costs are Cheaper in Municipalities with an Increase in Black Population
- Visualization type: Bar chart with selected municipality’s housing costs
- Color: Use theme color to highlight the housing costs for municipalities that gained Black population. 
- Context: Black families are seeking lower housing costs outside the City of Pittsburgh, perhaps due to gentrification 
- Possible sources: 
  - Allegheny County Economic Development
  - Redfin 
  - Need to explore other data sources. Hard to find rental data. 


8. Property Taxes are Lower in Municipalities with an Increase in Black Population
- Visualization type: Bar graph with values sorted descending. 
- Color: Use theme color to highlight the property taxes for municipalities that gained Black population. 
- Context: Black families are seeking lower costs outside the City of Pittsburgh. 
- Source: Allegheny County Treasurer 
- Perhaps exclude this section, based on length and flow. 


9. Why This Trend is Concerning: Black Pittsburghers do not feel like they can thrive in The City of Pittsburgh 
- Visualization type: Bar graph or call out statistics 
- Color & Context: Use theme color to highlight how open the Black population perceives the city to be to diversity, and is most likely to leave neighborhoods
- Source: POISE Foundation
- I have not created a sketch of this visualization yet, but I will continue to iterate on this idea for the second draft of the final project. 


10. Why This Trend is Concerning: This Demographic Shift is Concerning for the City of Pittsburgh for Many Reasons

- I have not created a sketch of this visualization yet, but I will continue to iterate on this idea for the second draft of the final project.


11. Call to Action: The City of Pittsburgh Sould Create a Task Force Dedicated to Researching and Recommending Specific Measures to Improve the Quality of Life for Black Pittsburghers.
- Visualization type: Infographic (will collect feedback during user research) 
- Color: None or limited theme color
- Context: Readers should contact the incoming Gainey administration and demand that retaining Black residents must be a policy priority during his time in office
- Source: n/a

## Sources

### Data 
The primary data source for this project will be the United State Census Bureau (Census) 2010 and 2020 data. As mentioned above, the initial idea for this project stemmed from the release of the 2020 Census Data. I will either pull the relevant data tables from the Census website, or read out the major statistics from the Pittsburgh City Paper’s article listed below. I will also use the following data sources to provide context for this demographic shift: US News, Allegheny County Economic Development, Redfin, Allegheny County Treasurer, and POISE Foundation. I am still exploring the best source to provide housing cost data. Below are links to all of the sources.

## Method and Medium 
For the final project, I intend to compile the data visualizations and text in Shorthand. I am already familiar with ESRI’s StoryMaps, so I am excited to learn a new, but similar tool. I will create the data visualizations in Flourish and Tableau, and embed them in the Shorthand page. To minimize copyright issues, I will explore images on Unsplash. From what I have seen in class, Shorthand will also be an appropriate visual aid for the final presentation. I will prepare talking points and scroll through the Shorthand page.

Between now and the final presentation, I will create storyboards and conduct user research to improve on my project proposal. I hope to interview users who are both familiar and not familiar with Pittsburgh local politics, to ensure that they can both understand the story. I will ask them questions about visualization format, story flow, and story length. Using their feedback I will iterate on the sketches, visualizations, and text to arrive at the final product.
