# About me
Iâ€™m Sophie Abo, a second year in the MS Public Policy and Management program at Carnegie Mellong University (CMU). I grew up in Pittsburgh and completed my undergraduate degree in Environmental Health and Biology at Washington University in St. Louis. I returned to Pittsburgh for the Coro Fellowship in Public Affairs and stuck around to attend CMU! This past summer I interned at the Brookings Institution in the Metropolitan Policy Program as an Infrastructure Research Intern. My interests include infrastructure policy and planning, economic development, and sustainability! After graduation, I hope to work in the fields of urban planning and transportation policy. I'm seeking opportunities that will allow me to use my research, data analysis, and technical project management skills to address our built environment's most pressing challenges and opportunities.

Outside of school/work, I love biking, exploring Pittsburgh and other cities, and cooking and baking! This photo is from a trip to Asheville, NC earlier this summer.

# What I hope to learn 
During TSWD I hope to learn about different types of data visualizations, the tools needed to create those visulaizations, and which visualizations are best suited for which situations. I am espeically excited to learn how to produce interactive data visualizations and create a portfolio of work. I believe that being able to create visualizations will help me effectively describe data and trends throughout my career.
