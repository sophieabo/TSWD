# About me
Iâ€™m Sophie Abo, a second year in the MS Public Policy and Management program at Carnegie Mellong University (CMU). I grew up in Pittsburgh and completed my undergraduate degree in Environmental Health and Biology at Washington University in St. Louis. I returned to Pittsburgh for the Coro Fellowship in Public Affairs and stuck around to attend CMU! This past summer I interned at the Brookings Institution in the Metropolitan Policy Program as an Infrastructure Research Intern. My interests include infrastructure policy and planning, economic development, and sustainability! After graduation, I hope to work in the fields of urban planning and transportation policy. I'm seeking opportunities that will allow me to use my research, data analysis, and technical project management skills to address our built environment's most pressing challenges and opportunities.

Outside of school/work, I love biking, exploring Pittsburgh and other cities, and cooking and baking! This photo is from a trip to Asheville, NC earlier this summer.

# What I hope to learn 
During TSWD I hope to learn about different types of data visualizations, the tools needed to create those visulaizations, and which visualizations are best suited for which situations. I am espeically excited to learn how to produce interactive data visualizations and create a portfolio of work. I believe that being able to create visualizations will help me effectively describe data and trends throughout my career.

## Critques


## OECD General Government Debt Visualizations
### OECD Bar Chart

### OECD Grid of Line Charts

This visualization uses the same dataset that the OECD bar chart is created from. By using a "Grid of Lines Charts" I can easily visualize all of the countries from 1995 to 2020. The bar chart was only useful to represent the Debt-to-GDP ratio during one year. In addition to the design elements mentioned in the tutorial, I added an informative title and subtitle. I decided to highlight that a "Low Debt-to-GDP Ratio Indicates Strong Government Fiscal Health." Since the visualization includes so many countries, this title allows readers to look at their countries of interest and draw a conclusion based on contextual information. I also added a y-axis legend "Debt-to-GDP ratio." I thought that was more informative than labeling each line. Overall, I think this visualization works well as a general reference graphic. 

### OECD Line Chart

This third visualization also uses the same OECD general government debt dataset. Since the recent elections in Germany, I have read many articles celebrating Angela Merkel's legacy of fiscal stability. In this visualization, I wanted to explore Germany's fiscal health and Debt-to-GDP Ratio. I chose a line graph to represent Debt-to-GDP Ratio (a measure of fiscal health and ability to pay back debt) over the last 25 years. I chose to visualize Geremany's trajectory alongside it's G7 peers, to illustrate that Geremany is uniquely fiscally stable amongst the world's advanced economies. I chose Germany's line to be yellow, to evoke the German national flag. The other color in Germany's flag is red; I did not want to use red, because this visualization highlights a positive trend. I used grey for the rest of the visualization, to draw the reader's attention to Germany's line. I chose to label the lines with the country's commonly used 3-letter abbreviation. This is a design element that I have encorporated into my personal aesthetic through the readings and design critques. Since these are widely recognizable abbreviation, I thought this design element worked well here. I added an annotation at 2008, to emphasize that when the other G7 countries' Debt-to-GDP ratio rapidly increased after the 2008 financial crisis, Germany's only slightly increased and then decreased. I also added an informative title and subtitle to explicitly state this observation. While line charts are not the most complex visualizations, a clean, informative line chart can be successful at telling a compelling story!

In this exercise, I visualized OECD government debt in 3 ways. With the bar chart, I explored debt in 2019 across all countries in the dataset. In this visualization, you can clearly see which countries have proportionally more debt. Suprisingly, Japan has the hightest Debt-to-GDP ratio. The grid of line charts visualizes Debt-to-GDP ratios overtime for each country. This amount of information is overwhelming for many chart types, but the grid of line charts does an effective job of distilling this information. As mentioned above, this is more a general reference graphic, rather than a specific chart that demonstrates one trend. The third visualization, the line chart, is better at visualizing a specific narrative with fewer categories. I thought the line chart was a good choice to illustrate Germany's fiscal stability as compared to G7 countries. Overall, this exercise demonstrated Flourish's ability to produce a wide variety of visually appealing charts, and that datasets can be visualized and narrativized in many ways!
